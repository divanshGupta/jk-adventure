✅ Modern Alternatives to Show 3 Service Categories
❤️Option 1: Interactive Horizontal Tabs or Segmented Control
Display all 3 categories as horizontal tabs (like buttons).
On click, show a set of preview cards (2-3 per category) without navigating away.
Below the cards: a “View All” button that routes to the full page.

Why it’s better:
Keeps user on the homepage longer.
Encourages exploration.

More dynamic feel.
❤️Option 2: Full-width Hero-style Service Blocks (Stacked)
Instead of 3 cards side-by-side, create stacked service sections with:
A background image or light colored block
Brief info about the service
1-2 featured offerings from that category (with images/pricing)
CTA button: "Explore Tour Packages"

Why it's better:
More room for storytelling and visuals
Engages visitors as they scroll
